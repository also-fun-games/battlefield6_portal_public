**Welcome**
Thanks for checking this code out.  I tried to make user-friendly notifications for in-world messages and console.log information that one may find here after starting a map/experience:
C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\Temp\Battlefieldâ„¢ 6PortalLog.txt.

Feel free to give me any feedback or repurpose the code.

**Notes**:
The "ongoing" functions report every frame so I added a debug flag named DEBUG_ONGOING to stop them.  If the flag is enabled, there is another config which will only let it report every 6 minutes (60000).  This can be adjusted.
